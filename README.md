## Project Summary
AI-Powered Quiz Generator from PPT/PDF to Google Form

This web application allows users to upload a PDF or PPTX file (such as lecture notes, presentations, or study materials). The system uses AI to analyze the content and automatically generate a quiz based on it.

Once processed, the app creates a Google Form quiz with the generated questions and saves it directly to the user's own Google Drive, giving them full ownership and editing access.


## How It Works

1. User uploads a PDF or PPTX file.  
2. The app parses the file and extracts text content.  
3. Extracted text is sent to the Gemini AI model, which generates quiz questions in JSON format.  
4. Using the user's Google access token, the app sends the quiz data to the Google Forms API.  
5. A Google Form quiz is created or updated, and an editable form link is returned to the user.  
6. The user can access and edit the quiz directly in Google Forms.
